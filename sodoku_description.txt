This lab simulates a game of sodoku. The puzzle is a 9x9 grad in which every column contains the symbols 1-9 exactly once, every row contains the symbols 1-9 exact one, and each of the 3x3 minigrids contains the symbols 1-9 exactly once. 
This lab contains a simple Sodoku code, and (week 2) a solving algorithm that utilizes STL. 
Each puzzle is composed of 9 lines, each of which contains 9 values separated by a space. The Puzzle.h class is templated so that it can read in a file containing the traditional Sodoku puzzle, containing digits 0-9, or a Wordoku, which contains a mix of characters and numbers. The Sodoku program asks the player what number they would like to place where, and then proceeds to check that the entry is valid before placing the number in it's slot and displaying the updated board to the user. The game ends when all spots on the board are filled, or when the player chooses to quit because they have made a wrong move.
